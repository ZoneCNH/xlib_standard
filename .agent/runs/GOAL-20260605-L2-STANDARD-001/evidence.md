Run timestamp: 2026-06-05T12:48:00Z

Team: use-context-omx-conte-4451c8a9

## Objective

Execute docs/l2/01_xlib-standard_execution_plan.md for xlib-standard as a standards-only delivery. The implementation must define L2 registries, schemas, templates, testing guidance, and verification evidence without connecting to providers or implementing the downstream Contract Runner.

## Team Result

`omx team status use-context-omx-conte-4451c8a9` reported:

```text
tasks: total=4 pending=0 blocked=0 in_progress=0 completed=4 failed=0
```

Completed task results recorded:

- Task 1: delivered L2 registries, schemas, templates, docs/testing guidance, evidence reports, and governance index/generated-artifact alignment.
- Task 2: reported the completed artifact and gate set from Task 1.
- Task 3: recorded worker-2's no-assigned-task blocker with no implementation edits.
- Task 4: hardened L2 artifacts after leader QA by adding stronger invariants, expanded Makefile targets, a provider-neutral compose placeholder, a non-skipping manifest-shape contract test, and deeper testing guidance.

## Changed Artifact Groups

- `.agent/registry/l2-*.yaml`
- `.agent/schemas/l2-*.schema.json`
- `.agent/evidence/l2-standard/*.json`
- `.agent/index.yaml`
- `.agent/registries/generated-artifacts.yaml`
- `docs/l2/01_xlib-standard_execution_plan.md`
- `docs/testing/l2-*.md`
- `scripts/verify_l2_standard.py`
- `templates/l2/**`

## Verification Commands

All commands below were run from `/home/xlib-standard/.worktree/workspaces/l2-standard-source`.

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_l2_standard.py
make -C templates/l2 l2-manifest-check l2-evidence-check l2-release-readiness-check
make -C templates/l2 l2-capability-check l2-contract l2-integration l2-chaos l2-benchmark l2-adoption l2-evidence l2-release-readiness
GOWORK=off go test ./...
GOWORK=off go vet ./...
GOWORK=off make schema-check
GOWORK=off make docs-check
git diff --check
git status --short --branch --untracked-files=all
```

## Verification Results

- `python3 scripts/verify_l2_standard.py`: PASS, 18 checks, evidence directory `.agent/evidence/l2-standard`.
- `make -C templates/l2 l2-manifest-check l2-evidence-check l2-release-readiness-check`: PASS.
- `make -C templates/l2 l2-capability-check l2-contract l2-integration l2-chaos l2-benchmark l2-adoption l2-evidence l2-release-readiness`: PASS.
- `GOWORK=off go test ./...`: PASS, including `templates/l2/test/contract`.
- `GOWORK=off go vet ./...`: PASS.
- `GOWORK=off make schema-check`: PASS.
- `GOWORK=off make docs-check`: PASS.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- `git status --short --branch --untracked-files=all`: clean before this evidence file was added.

## Risks And Boundaries

- Provider-backed adapter execution is intentionally not tested in this repository.
- Contract Runner implementation is intentionally not included in this repository.
- Downstream L2 repositories must copy/adapt `templates/l2`, populate provider capabilities, and produce provider-backed evidence under `.agent/evidence/l2`.

## Follow-up

- Run downstream provider-backed L2 adoption against these standards in xlibgate or adapter repositories.
- Use the L2 release levels and contract-pack registry to adjudicate L2-T3 and L2-T4 readiness downstream.
