# Unattended Branch Governance Runbook

Unattended branch governance is the controlled cleanup workflow for reducing a repository back to a single healthy `main` branch. It is allowed only when the operator can prove every non-`main` branch has been audited, any potentially valuable unsafe branch has a backup ref, safe commits have been integrated, and the final `main` state matches `origin/main` with a clean worktree.

This runbook is intentionally conservative: deletion is the last step, not the classification mechanism.

## Required invariants

- `main` is the only release branch and must remain aligned with `origin/main` before completion.
- Local write work must not happen directly on `main`; use a worker worktree or temporary review branch until the final fast-forward/merge point.
- Branches with unknown, unmerged, or conflicting value must be backed up before any destructive action.
- Release verification must run with `XLIB_CONTEXT=release_verify` and `GOWORK=off` so local workspace state cannot mask release drift.
- Completion evidence must include the branch inventory, disposition for each non-`main` branch, backup refs created, merges performed, deletions performed, and final verification commands.

## Branch classification

Classify every branch other than `main` into exactly one bucket:

| Bucket | Meaning | Required action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `safe-merge` | Contains useful commits that apply cleanly and pass the relevant gates. | Merge or cherry-pick into `main`, then verify. |
| `backup-only` | May contain value but cannot be safely merged unattended because it conflicts, is incomplete, or lacks clear ownership. | Create a backup ref before cleanup and record why it was not merged. |
| `duplicate` | Already reachable from `main` or another kept backup ref. | Delete after recording the duplicate base. |
| `stale-worthless` | Obsolete experiment, generated noise, or branch with no useful diff. | Delete after audit evidence proves no unique value. |
| `blocked` | Requires owner, credential, external CI, or destructive decision outside the current scope. | Stop the unattended cleanup and report the blocker. |

Do not use branch age alone as a deletion reason. Age can support a `stale-worthless` classification only when the diff and commit history also show no retained value.

## Safe local procedure

Run read-only inventory first:

```bash
git fetch --prune origin
git branch --format='%(refname:short) %(objectname:short) %(committerdate:iso8601) %(upstream:short)'
git branch -r --format='%(refname:short) %(objectname:short) %(committerdate:iso8601)'
```

For each candidate branch, inspect reachability and unique content:

```bash
git log --oneline --decorate --left-right main...<branch>
git diff --stat main...<branch>
git diff --name-status main...<branch>
```

For any `backup-only` branch, create a durable backup ref before deletion or reset:

```bash
git branch backup/<yyyy-mm-dd>/<branch-name> <branch>
git push origin refs/heads/backup/<yyyy-mm-dd>/<branch-name>
```

Only merge `safe-merge` branches after confirming the patch is intentional and testable:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git merge --no-ff <branch>
GOWORK=off make docs-check
GOWORK=off go test ./...
```

If a merge fails, abort it and reclassify the branch as `backup-only` or `blocked`:

```bash
git merge --abort
```

After all safe integrations are complete, delete only branches that have an audit disposition and, when needed, a backup ref:

```bash
git branch -d <duplicate-or-merged-branch>
git branch -D <stale-worthless-branch>   # only with recorded audit evidence
git push origin --delete <remote-branch>  # only after local evidence is complete
```

## Final verification

The final state must prove that release automation would see the same clean `main` as the remote:

```bash
git switch main
git fetch --quiet origin main --tags
test "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" = "$(git rev-parse origin/main)"
test -z "$(git status --porcelain)"
test "$(git branch --format='%(refname:short)' | grep -vc '^main$')" = "0"
XLIB_CONTEXT=release_verify GOWORK=off make release-preflight VERSION=<next-version>
```

`release-preflight` enforces the mechanical release guard: valid version, current branch is `main`, clean worktree, `HEAD == origin/main`, absent local and remote tag, matching `CHANGELOG.md` heading, required lint tooling, and vulnerability-scan tooling when the vulnerability window requires it.

## Evidence template

Record the following in the task result, PR, or release evidence:

```text
Branch governance evidence:
- Inventory command/date:
- Branch classifications:
  - <branch>: <safe-merge|backup-only|duplicate|stale-worthless|blocked> — <reason>
- Backup refs created:
- Merges/cherry-picks performed:
- Branches deleted locally:
- Branches deleted remotely:
- Final HEAD:
- origin/main:
- Final branch list:
- Verification:
  - git status --porcelain: <empty>
  - main == origin/main: <pass/fail>
  - release-preflight: <pass/fail + VERSION>
```

If any branch is `blocked`, do not claim unattended cleanup complete. Report the blocker and leave the branch or its backup ref intact.
