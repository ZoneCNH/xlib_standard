# L2 Evidence Standard

xlib-standard is the standards source. It defines artifact shape, required evidence, and release semantics only. testkitx owns executable contract libraries, and xlibgate owns release adjudication. This repository must remain provider-neutral: no provider connections, no credentials loading, and no Contract Runner implementation live here.

Evidence must be reproducible, machine-readable where possible, and linked to manifest capabilities, selected contract packs, required profiles, and release-level decisions. The canonical downstream output root is `.agent/evidence/l2`.

## Minimum evidence set

- Contract report for each selected pack.
- Compliance matrix mapping requirements, packs, profiles, evidence paths, and status.
- Integration, chaos, benchmark, and adoption reports when required by the requested release level.
- Release-readiness summary produced for xlibgate adjudication.

## Evidence quality

Evidence should name the manifest version, adapter module, selected packs, command or workflow that produced the report, timestamp, and pass/fail status. A missing file or empty placeholder is not passing evidence. Standards templates may include `.gitkeep` files to establish directories, but downstream release claims must include real reports.

## Failure handling

When a profile fails, preserve the failing evidence and record the blocker. Do not remove the profile, lower the target release level without review, or add provider-specific bypasses to xlib-standard.
