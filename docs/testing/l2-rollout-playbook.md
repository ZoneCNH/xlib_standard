# L2 Rollout Playbook

xlib-standard is the standards source. It defines artifact shape, required evidence, and release semantics only. testkitx owns executable contract libraries, and xlibgate owns release adjudication. This repository must remain provider-neutral: no provider connections, no credentials loading, and no Contract Runner implementation live here.

## Sequence

1. Copy `templates/l2` into the L2 repository.
2. Fill adapter metadata, declared capabilities, selected contract packs, and evidence report paths.
3. Run `make l2-capability-check l2-evidence` to prove local shape.
4. Wire testkitx in the downstream repository and generate contract reports.
5. Add integration, chaos, benchmark, and adoption evidence as the target release level requires.
6. Run `make l2-release-readiness` and submit the evidence bundle to xlibgate.
7. Record blockers instead of weakening release criteria.

## Rollout controls

Start at `L2-T0` until the manifest and evidence directory are stable. Promote one release level at a time, preserving failed evidence and review notes. Keep compatibility notes for adapters that share families or pack selections so regressions can be compared across downstream repositories.

## Stop conditions

Stop rollout when selected packs lack executable testkitx coverage, required reports are missing, or provider-specific behavior cannot be represented by existing pack semantics. Escalate the gap through the xlib-standard backlog rather than adding local exceptions.

Evidence paths for release claims should remain under `.agent/evidence/l2` unless xlib-standard changes the schema.
