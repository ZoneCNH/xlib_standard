# L2 Release Gate

xlib-standard is the standards source. It defines artifact shape, required evidence, and release semantics only. testkitx owns executable contract libraries, and xlibgate owns release adjudication. This repository must remain provider-neutral: no provider connections, no credentials loading, and no Contract Runner implementation live here.

Release levels are defined in `.agent/registry/l2-release-levels.yaml` and may not be redefined downstream. L2-T3 is the first release-allowed level; L2-T4 is factory-grade.

## Level expectations

- `L2-T0` proves skeleton readiness only.
- `L2-T1` requires unit and contract profiles.
- `L2-T2` adds integration evidence.
- `L2-T3` adds chaos, benchmark, and adoption evidence and allows release.
- `L2-T4` adds retrospective evidence and allows factory-grade claims.

## Gate behavior

Gates fail closed when required profiles, evidence paths, selected pack reports, or compatibility notes are missing. xlibgate adjudicates the evidence against this registry; xlib-standard only defines the release semantics and template targets.

## Template targets

`make l2-release-readiness` checks the local standards shape and points downstream to xlibgate. The compatibility aliases `l2-release-readiness-check`, `l2-manifest-check`, and `l2-evidence-check` remain available for existing workflows.

Evidence paths for release claims should remain under `.agent/evidence/l2` unless xlib-standard changes the schema.
