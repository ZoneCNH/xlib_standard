# L2 Contract Pack Registry

xlib-standard is the standards source. It defines artifact shape, required evidence, and release semantics only. testkitx owns executable contract libraries, and xlibgate owns release adjudication. This repository must remain provider-neutral: no provider connections, no credentials loading, and no Contract Runner implementation live here.

The registry is `.agent/registry/l2-contract-packs.yaml` and is validated by `.agent/schemas/l2-contract-packs.schema.json`. Pack entries define family, title, required profiles, required evidence, and capability names.

## Pack fields

- `family` groups capabilities into common, key-value, relational, messaging, streaming, storage, analytics, or time-series domains.
- `profiles` names the evidence stages needed to prove the pack.
- `required_evidence` names report classes expected from downstream execution.
- `capabilities` lists semantic operations covered by the pack.

## Backlog discipline

`extension_backlog` records standards candidates that are not yet first-class pack definitions or still need downstream evidence maturity. Items such as `ttl` may appear there when leader QA wants explicit tracking even if an initial pack exists. Backlog entries are planning markers only; they are not executable tests.

## Ownership boundary

xlib-standard may add, rename, or retire pack definitions. testkitx implements the executable checks. Downstream adapters select packs and publish evidence; they do not redefine pack semantics locally.

Evidence paths for release claims should remain under `.agent/evidence/l2` unless xlib-standard changes the schema.
