# L2 Capability Manifest

xlib-standard is the standards source. It defines artifact shape, required evidence, and release semantics only. testkitx owns executable contract libraries, and xlibgate owns release adjudication. This repository must remain provider-neutral: no provider connections, no credentials loading, and no Contract Runner implementation live here.

The manifest schema is `.agent/schemas/l2-capabilities.schema.json`; the downstream template is `templates/l2/.agent/l2-capabilities.yaml`. The template is intentionally local and provider-neutral so new adapters can start by proving shape before wiring testkitx.

## Required sections

- `schema_version` identifies the standards schema version.
- `layer` must be `L2`.
- `adapter` records name, module, family, and owners.
- `capabilities` declares each adapter capability with family and status.
- `contract_packs` maps capabilities to xlib-standard registry packs.
- `evidence` records required profiles, output directory, and report paths.

## Invariants

Every selected pack must exist in `.agent/registry/l2-contract-packs.yaml`. Evidence paths should stay under `.agent/evidence/l2`. Manifests should describe adapter intent only; live connection details, runtime credential loading, and runner wiring belong in the adopting repository and should not be committed into xlib-standard artifacts.

## Local checks

Run `make l2-capability-check` in the template to confirm the manifest exists. Downstream repositories should then validate the manifest against the schema before invoking testkitx or xlibgate.
