# L2 Adapter Testing Standard

xlib-standard is the standards source. It defines artifact shape, required evidence, and release semantics only. testkitx owns executable contract libraries, and xlibgate owns release adjudication. This repository must remain provider-neutral: no provider connections, no credentials loading, and no Contract Runner implementation live here.

## Required downstream flow

1. Copy `templates/l2` into the L2 adapter repository.
2. Complete `.agent/l2-capabilities.yaml` with adapter metadata, capability declarations, selected contract packs, and evidence paths.
3. Run the template shape gates first: `make l2-capability-check l2-evidence`.
4. Wire executable testkitx packs downstream and keep their reports under `.agent/evidence/l2`.
5. Run profile stages in order: `l2-contract`, `l2-integration`, `l2-chaos`, `l2-benchmark`, and `l2-adoption`.
6. Submit evidence to xlibgate for release-readiness adjudication without weakening xlib-standard release levels.

## Profile semantics

- `skeleton` proves the manifest and evidence directories exist.
- `unit` proves local adapter behavior without live provider dependencies.
- `contract` proves declared packs such as `common`, `kv`, and `ttl` against testkitx.
- `integration`, `chaos`, and `benchmark` prove downstream service behavior and must be recorded as evidence, not encoded in this standards repository.
- `adoption` and `retrospective` prove rollout safety, compatibility notes, and post-release learnings.

## Pass criteria

A downstream adapter is L2-ready only when every declared capability maps to a registry pack, every required profile has machine-readable evidence, and xlibgate confirms the requested release level. Missing evidence is a blocker, not a reason to lower the standard.
