# L2 Downstream Adoption

xlib-standard is the standards source. It defines artifact shape, required evidence, and release semantics only. testkitx owns executable contract libraries, and xlibgate owns release adjudication. This repository must remain provider-neutral: no provider connections, no credentials loading, and no Contract Runner implementation live here.

Adopting repositories consume xlib-standard templates and registries without redefining release levels. They may add provider-specific services, credentials loading, concrete compose services, and Contract Runner wiring only in their own repository.

## Adoption checklist

- Keep `.agent/l2-capabilities.yaml` schema-valid.
- Select only registry-defined contract packs unless a backlog item has been promoted.
- Preserve evidence under `.agent/evidence/l2`.
- Keep xlib-standard template aliases available when local Makefiles wrap them.
- Publish compliance, compatibility, and release-readiness reports with each release claim.

## Template behavior

The included template starts with local shape checks and provider-neutral placeholders. The compose file uses a placeholder profile and no network access by default, so adopting repositories can prove paths before adding services.

## Upgrade path

When xlib-standard updates schemas or release levels, downstream repositories should update manifests first, rerun shape checks, then rerun executable testkitx profiles and xlibgate adjudication.
